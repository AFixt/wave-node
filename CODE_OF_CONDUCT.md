# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected of all community members:

- **Be Respectful**: Value each other's ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners.
- **Be Direct but Professional**: We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
- **Be Inclusive**: Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable.
- **Understand Different Perspectives**: Our goal should not be to "win" every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better.
- **Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences**: We all come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing.
- **Lead by Example**: By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable:

- **Violence and Threats of Violence**: This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm.
- **Personal Attacks**: Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others.
- **Derogatory Language**: Hurtful or harmful language related to any dimension of diversity is not acceptable.
- **Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact**: This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances.
- **Disruptive Behavior**: Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated.
- **Influencing Unacceptable Behavior**: We will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Bad behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from activities are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.

Reports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in you being ask to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.

## Reporting

If you believe you're experiencing unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated as outlined above, please report it by:

- **Email**: <talktous@afixt.com>
- **Issue Tracker**: Open an issue with the "Code of Conduct" label

After receiving a concise description of your situation, the project maintainers will review and determine next steps. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources.

Please note that without a clear understanding of the violation and the person who is accused of violation, we will not be able to take any action.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
